# Collaborate on Postman Tests for DS Algorithm

## Business Benefit
We want to strengthen our Quality efforts and collaboration between the Data Science and Quality Assurance around the DS Algorithms (especially in "Dispo. Neu"). Therefor we need to enhance the technical collaboration between these two teams.Â 

## Background
Since both team are familiar Postman in this Spike we want to figure out what would be the best way to collaborate using Postman. As WALTER GROUP is already in possession of Postman Licenses we want to explore the possibilities we have with this commercial license.

## Requirements
- Full Licenses of Postman
- at least trial account for Postman Galaxy
- Access to existing Component Tests for DS Planning Algorithm

## Acceptance Criteria
- Developer must be able the create, edit and list all the postman tests
- Tester must be able the create, edit and list all the postman tests that developers manage
- Postman Tests can be written in a way that for differente scenarios we can use the same request but change parameters (as variables) 
- Integration of the execution of the tests in CI Tools (a.k.a. Newman)

## Questions to answer
- What Options for Collaboration do we have if we use Postman Galaxy in favor of git to fulfil the acceptance criteria?
- Can we fulfil the criteria using git
- What are the costs if we use Galaxy?
- What costs do we expect if we use Githab?
- Can we implement different scenarios using postman as mentioned in Accptance Criteria?

## Results
Results ** should be documented in an Architectural Decision Record and presented to DS Planning Team incl. Kecman, Milos, Brandhuber, Martin and Richter, Franz

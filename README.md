## 👋 Introduction
The API testing workspace is designed to provide a collaborative environment for developers and testers to thoroughly test APIs before they are released to production.

This workspace is equipped with different collections that can help you perform various tests for your APIs.

## 🚀 Getting started with this workspace
You can either send individual requests in these collections or use the Postman collection runner to run all the requests in the collection manually. If needed, you can also schedule and automate your collection runs to test your APIs continuously.

We've included some example collections to illustrate how you can build a test suite for various use cases like contract, integration and performance testing.

We've also included the Intro to Writing Tests collection to help you start writing tests. We hope this workspace enables you to detect API issues early.

## 🐞 Reporting issues
If you find API issues or bugs when testing, please create a ticket and assign it to a member of the development team.

## Help and support
If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to your manager or any member of the Quality Engineering team.
